# CS 4850 Program 5: An Interpreter

# Overview
This project involves extending the interpreter from the previous assignment for user-defined functions, function calls of user-defined functions, a sequence of expression, and `let`-expressions in the Scheme programming language.

# Software installation
To install pytest, run the following command in a Terminal:

`pip3 install pytest`

# The Assignment
The Scheme programming language is a variant of Lisp that has static scoping. Scheme has an expression-oriented syntax that uses prefix notation. The following is a grammar for the subset of Scheme for which we will write an interpreter in this assignment.
